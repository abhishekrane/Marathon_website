IMPORTANT, IMPORTANT:  You must set permissions to 777 for the destination folder
for uploaded images.  However, you must not--under any circumstances--set 777 
permissions on any other folders, nor can your upload directory be visible, EVER.

NOTE:  This example works correctly but is incomplete.

$_FILES array elements:

    $_FILES["file"]["name"] - the name of the uploaded file
    $_FILES["file"]["type"] - the type of the uploaded file
    $_FILES["file"]["size"] - the size in bytes of the uploaded file
    $_FILES["file"]["tmp_name"] - the name of the temporary copy of the file stored on the server
    $_FILES["file"]["error"] - the error code resulting from the file upload
    
    
 UPLOAD_ERR_OK         Value: 0; There is no error, the file uploaded with success.
 UPLOAD_ERR_INI_SIZE   Value: 1; The uploaded file exceeds the upload_max_filesize directive in php.ini.
                                 This value is set on jadran to 2MB.
 UPLOAD_ERR_FORM_SIZE  Value: 2; The uploaded file exceeds the MAX_FILE_SIZE directive that was specified in the HTML form.
 UPLOAD_ERR_PARTIAL    Value: 3; The uploaded file was only partially uploaded.
 UPLOAD_ERR_NO_FILE    Value: 4; No file was uploaded.
 UPLOAD_ERR_NO_TMP_DIR Value: 6; Missing a temporary folder. Introduced in PHP 4.3.10 and PHP 5.0.3.
 UPLOAD_ERR_CANT_WRITE Value: 7; Failed to write file to disk. Introduced in PHP 5.1.0.
 UPLOAD_ERR_EXTENSION  Value: 8; File upload stopped by extension. Introduced in PHP 5.2.0.
